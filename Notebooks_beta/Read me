The python scripts found here are for the beta version of the WaPOR Irrigation Performance Assessment (WaPORIPA) repository. This is a basic repository that utilises seasonally aggregated WaPORv3 or pyWaPOR outputs to calculate:
- Land and water productivity, which if crop type information is available can estimate crop yield
- Irrigation performance indicators, including adequacy, beneficial fraction, equity, relative water deficit

The water accounting team is working on expanding the analyses to include, which will be published in WaPORIPAv1:
- water productivity and yield gap analyses
- estimating crop water requirements and ETblue
