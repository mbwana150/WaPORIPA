This repository was developed as part of the [“Monitoring land and water productivity by Remote Sensing (WaPOR phase 2) project”](https://www.fao.org/in-action/remote-sensing-for-water-productivity/en/) led by FAO and funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands. 

The script is also used in on-campus short course on ['Remote Sensing for Agricultural Water Management'](https://www.un-ihe.org/courses/on-campus/remote-sensing-agricultural-water-management) organised annually by IHE Delft Institute for Water Education
